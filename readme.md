* [commentcount](./commentcount) Reports a simple count of the number of comments for a site. Also reports the number of threads and average comment count per thread. You can read more about it here: [Working with the Disqus API - Comment Count](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2016/08/18/working-with-the-disqus-api-comment-count/)
